# Seniorbank - A Simplified Banking Prototype
## The project


### About
**SeniorBank is a prototype** designed to enhance digital banking security for elderly users and vulnerable groups who are increasingly targeted by online fraud


**The project** focuses on preventing common scams such as phishing, investment fraud, and romance scams while ensuring accessibility and ease of use




**This initiative** was developed in collaboration with 
**SpareBank 1 Utvikling** 
which provides digital banking solutions for multiple Norwegian banks

---
###  Project Objectives and Goals:
- **Improve Fraud Prevention:** Implement measures to detect and prevent common scams before they succeed.
- **Enhance Accessibility:** Design an intuitive user experience tailored to elderly users.
- **Prototype Security Features:** Develop and demonstrate effective fraud prevention techniques without unnecessary complexity.

### Scope & Boundaries:
- The prototype **does not** handle real banking transactions (mock data only).
- Focus on **UX/UI** and **fraud prevention logic**, rather than full banking functionality.

# Technologies



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).



Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future: 




## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. 
<br>- The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
